This is a core implementation of the Horus Service, it is not a standalone plugin, it has no API to call.

	1. Make a copy of the existing Moodle directory or install a new Moodle service.
	2. Make a copy of the existing Moodle database which is wanted to be anonymised.
		If you installed a naked Moodle, use the original database (that you want to anonymise) instead of the new installation database.
	3. Copy the horus directory (the source of the Horus Service) into the Moodle's directory (top-level, where the config.php is also stored).
	4. Set Moodle's directory to include the config.php of the Moodle core in common\CommonDatabaseTranslator file.
